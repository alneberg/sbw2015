                    <h2>About SBW 2015</h2>
                    <p>The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop (SBW) is a two day conference/workshop held every year in Sweden at alternating university locations. The main target audience of SBW is PhD students in Sweden working in the diverse field of bioinformatics. At SBW, PhD students get to present their own projects as well as to learn about contemporary research projects through talks and poster sessions. Additionally, participants can choose from practical workshop sessions of their interest as well as to listen to high impact keynote speakers.</p>

                                <h4>Our heaven is their hell:</br>when data is easy, but results are not.</h4>
                                Dr. Lennart Martens is a professor of Systems Biology at Ghent University (Belgium). Dr. Martens foundation in bioinformatics lies in the analysis of the proteome but his current focus is on computational and data integration tools across multiple omics fields. Apart from numerous pertinent publications to the field Dr. Martens has co-authored textbooks on Proteomics Bioinformatics. </br>

                                <h4>The Sequences of the Genomes of a Nation:</br> What do they tell us?</h4>
                                Dr. Stefánsson is the president, chairman, CEO and co-founder of deCODE genetics. Since it’s foundation in 1996, deCODE has been one of the leading figures in human genomic research, publishing high impact findings associating genomic variants to Alzheimer disease and nicotine addiction to just name a few. In early 2015 the scientists at deCODE, led by Dr. Stefánsson, published four papers on the genomes of the Icelandic population, the largest genome population study to date. </br>
